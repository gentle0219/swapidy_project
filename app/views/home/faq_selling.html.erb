    <dt>
      What do I do once I get my Honey?
    </dt>
    <dd>
       You must ship your product(s) within 72 hours with the prepaid USPS shipping label we sent you via email. If the products aren't shipped within 72 hours, we will cancel any orders you placed with the Honey and subtract the Honey from your account. You can buy products right away but they won't be shipped if we are still waiting on your products, if any.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      I lost/deleted the email with my USPS prepaid label in it. What do I do?
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Simply email money@swapidy.com to request for a new one. Make sure to mention the item you sold.

      Where do I drop off my package once I put my prepaid label on the box?

      Simply drop it off in your mailbox, drop off centers, or your nearest post office which can be found here: https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.action

      Can I receive my product back once I've shipped it out?

      What if the product I sent was faulty and/or didn't match Swapidy's description of poor, good, or flawless?
