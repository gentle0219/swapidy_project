Good Day <%= @user.name_in_email %>,<br />
<br />
The honey bees over at Swapidy have determined that your <%= @order.product.title %> does not meet our standards.<br />
<br />
At Swapidy, we try to maintain our quality of honey to be the finest possible and in this case we can't accept the product in exchange for our precious honey.<br />
<br />
We will be sending the product back to you and you should receive it within 3-5 business days. We will also be subtracting the honey from your account and canceling any orders you placed using the honey from this product.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any inconveniences!<br />
